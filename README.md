# Syllabus outline ZkSync Summer Bootcamp:

## Goal:

By the end of the boot camp, all the boot campers should get a clear overview of Zero-knowledge and ZK math, and they should be able to write ZK Circuits & create ZK applications on their own, together with having a good overview of the Blockchain ecosystem.

## Timings: 

- Kickoff: 6th or 7th of May 2024, offline.

- Number of Weeks: 8 Week(s) + 1 Week.

- Number of days a week: 
    - Content for five days, up to the boot camp.
    - 2 online sessions a week.
    - 1 online session will be on giving an overview of the week's syllabus. (think of it as video lectures in MOOC).
    - The other session could be doubt-solving or an overview session.

## Content:

- General Recommendation: Learn Rust from Day 0. 

### Week 1:
- General intro to Ethereum, Solana.
- How do Ethereum & Solana work at the consensus and execution layer?
- Role of consensus layer.

Additional content(only for those interested): Docs of Alchemy to build a DApp.

### Week 2:

This week acts as a starter to Rust for everyone and to make everyone code in Rust at a basic level. 

- Development on Ethereum(probably in Rust/GO ðŸ˜‰).
- Decentralised Identities, Bridges(ZK and non ZK bridges).

### Week 3:

This week gives an overview of most of the essential concepts in web3.

- Ethereum's Rollup-centric roadmap and alt narratives...
- OP Rollups, ZK Rollups, Validiums.
- DA Layers, Alt VMs(MoveVM, WasmVM, Solana VM)
- Consensus Layers

### Week 4: Intro to ZK

- What is ZK?
- What is a SNARK & STARK? 
- Types of SNARKs & STARKS.
- Fields & Groups.
- Circom/Gnark.

### Week 5- Week 7: Rust + ZK  --> Circuit writing in rust.

The most crucial part of the boot camp. Those who complete this can understand and write circuits and build Zk Dapps independently.

- Groth 16, Plonk
- Starks, AIR, Plonkish Systems
- Plonky2, Halo2, KGZ, NOVA, IPA, Pedersen commitments...
- IVC, Lookups, Range checks
- DEEP FRI, Recursion
- FFT, NTT, Fiat Shamir, Lagrange Basis, Low degree extensions.

- Libraries -> Ark works/lambda works (Winterfell, bellman)

These are taught in theory and code.

### Week 8:

- ZK EVM, ZK Rollups.
- Sequencers
- ZK-DSL(s)


### Extra Week :

- More on ZK Math.
- ZK ML
